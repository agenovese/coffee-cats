/**
 * An Abstract Data Type for immutable linked lists representing ordered collections of elements of type A.
 *
 * <p>This ADT comes with two implementing case classes Nil and Cons that implement the abstract
 * members isEmpty, head and tail.
 *
 * <p>This ADT is optimal for last-in-first-out (LIFO), stack-like access patterns.
 * If you need another access pattern, for example, random access or FIFO,
 * consider using a collection more suited to this than List.
